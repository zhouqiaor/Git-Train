# Git commit template

Git commit template to improve your project's commit messages.

This commit template has a bunch of information inside,
and it's set up so you can freely edit it as you like.

If you want to learn why we use this kind of template,
see our repo [How to write a great git commit message](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/git_commit_message)

If you want to improve your git speed and capabilities,
see our repo  [Git alias configuration for shortcuts and enhancements](https://github.com/gitalias/gitalias)

## Usage ##

Put the template file here:

     ~/.git_commit_template.txt

Configure git to use the template file by running:

     git config --global commit.template ~/.git_commit_template.txt

Add the template file to our ~/.gitconfig file:

    [commit]
      template = ~/.git_commit_template.txt

If you prefer other file locations or ways of working,
you can freely adjust the usage as you like.
